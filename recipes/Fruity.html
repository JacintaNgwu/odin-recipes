      <p> I was looking for a different way to serve fruit, and it just popped into my head! Why not use fruit skewers?</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 large strawberries, halved </li>
            <li>Â¼ cantaloupe, cut into balls or cubes </li>
            <li>2 bananas, peeled and cut into chunks </li>
            <li>1 apple, cut into chunks </li>
            <li>20 skewers </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Thread the strawberries, cantaloupe, banana and apple pieces alternately onto skewers, placing at least 2 pieces of fruit on each skewer. Arrange the fruit skewers decoratively on a serving platter.</li>
        </ol>
