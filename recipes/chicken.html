      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <ul>
          <li>
            2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
          </li>
          <li>2 pounds chicken breast tenderloins, cut into bite-size pieces </li>

          <li>20 dried apricots </li>
          <li>1 cup chicken stock </li>
          <li>1 cup apricot preserves </li>
          <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme </li>
          <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley (Optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol><li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet with a lid over medium-high heat. 
        Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and cook in the hot oil until golden brown around the edges, but still pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir in the onion, and cook for about 3 minutes more. 
          Pour in the balsamic vinegar, bring it to a simmer, and allow it to reduce for a few minutes.</li>
          <li>Cut half of the apricots in half, leaving the others whole. Place the apricots into the skillet, and pour in the chicken stock. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the apricot preserves and thyme. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the apricots have softened, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve.</li>
